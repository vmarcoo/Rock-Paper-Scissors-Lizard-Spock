# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

This is a webpage created to play a "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" game 
made from scratch for The Odin Project's Foundations course. I intend 
to gradually improve the code's quality as I learn more features day after day. 

How to play? It's very easy (I guess...): Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, 
rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, 
lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and rock crushes scissors. 
Whoever throws the winning signal wins! If both of you make the same signal, it's a tie

Hope you all enjoy it!
